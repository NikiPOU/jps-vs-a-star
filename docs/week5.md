This week I continued working on the project by developing the UI in the main file, and testing. I also proceeded with further organizing the project and adding README, along with other docs.

The project has progressed in a more orderly matter. Even though the skeletal structure was there, I have been working to further develop what already existed.

Learning some general limitations and reactions in the algorithms given certain paths, such as ones with major blockades.

Testing the code has been a bit unclear. I was having a lot of errors in the test code and issues formatting it, as jps skips steps unlike A*, so they are not meant to have the same pathing pattern.

Next I will proceed with more formatting, UI design and testing.

This week I spent about 12 hours on the project.
