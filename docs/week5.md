This week I continued working on the project by developing the UI in the main file. I also proceeded with further organizing the project and adding README, along with other docs.

The project has progressed in a more orderly matter. Even though the skeletal structure was there, I have been working to further develop what already existed.

Learning some general limitations and reactions in the algorithms given certain paths, such as ones with major blockades.

Testing the code has been a bit unclear as I am quite unsure of the boundaries.

Next I will proceed with more formatting, UI design and testing.

This week I spent about 12 hours on the project.
