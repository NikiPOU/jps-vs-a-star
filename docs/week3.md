This week I continued initializing my poetry project, along with some basic code for the A* and JPS algorithms, and tests.

The program has progressed quite a bit since I had only initialized an empty repository prior to this. Now I have a solid foundation.

I learned how to work with poetry.

However, poetry has been throwing a lot of errors on my PC, which has been challenging and somewhat unclear.

Next, I will proceed with the project as a whole, in increments.

This week I spent about 10 hours on the project.
