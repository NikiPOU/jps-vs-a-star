This week I didn't work much on the project, and also missed the deadline & feedback window.

AS far as project progression goes, I have organized it a bit more, and cleaned out the code.

I've been mostly doing research this week, and not so much hands on work.

Still trying to get a good grasp of the subject and how to go about designing it, which has been the challanging part.

Next I would like to put my ideas into practice.

This week I spent about 6 hours on the project.
